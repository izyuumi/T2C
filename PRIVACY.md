# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: December 2, 2024**

## Overview

T2C ("Text to Calendar") is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your data stays on your device.

## Data Collection

**We collect nothing.** T2C does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## How T2C Works

### On-Device Processing
All natural language processing is performed entirely on your device using Apple's FoundationModels framework. Your text input is never sent to external servers, cloud services, or third parties.

### Calendar Access
T2C requests **write-only** access to your calendar. This means:
- ✅ T2C can create new calendar events
- ❌ T2C cannot read your existing calendar events
- ❌ T2C cannot access your calendar history

### No Network Requests
T2C does not make any network requests. The app functions entirely offline.

## Data Storage

T2C does not store:
- Your text inputs
- Created calendar events (these are stored by Apple's Calendar app)
- Usage analytics
- Crash reports
- Any personal information

## Third-Party Services

T2C uses no third-party services, SDKs, or analytics frameworks.

## Children's Privacy

T2C does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we update this privacy policy, changes will be posted here with an updated date.

**Summary: T2C processes everything on-device, requests only write-only calendar access, and collects zero data.**
